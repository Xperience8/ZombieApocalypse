# ZombieApocalypse
Windows, Unreal Engine, Solo project

Zombie Apocalypse is a third person shooter game. Zombies are everywhere and it looks like player has finally found safe place to live, but ...

The game is mission based. There is a basic world which is always loaded(terrain, buildings etc.). Every mission is a new sublevel. When player dies, only current mission will be reloaded. Therefore respawning is fast and there is no need for loading screens. You have to complete small tasks to move up in the story. Player is using weapon to kill zombies. He can shoot many shoots to the limbs, body or one shot to the head. Player can interact with some objects in the world(e.g. fruit to restore health). Objects which are interactable are highlighted, when player is close and he is looking on them.

Zombies

Zombie is hibernating(doesn't move), when it doesn't see or hear player. When it sees player, it will go toward him. If it loose him from the sight, it will go toward last known location. Zombie can hear player, when he is shooting or moving. When he is crouching, zombie can not hear him.
